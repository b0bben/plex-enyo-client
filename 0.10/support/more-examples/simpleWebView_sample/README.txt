This is a simple example of a webview component within a Enyo Application.  This sample has basic URL entry form with a "Go" button.  Please note when testing on desktop browsers, the functionality is limited to traditional iFrame capabilities.  

Note: Some event handlers will not work in this environment.  In these cases a device or emulator are required for full tests.
